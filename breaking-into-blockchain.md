# Breaking into Blockchain

## BlockChain 101

- Allows for a fully distributed internet

## Additional vocab

- dApp - Decentralized app
- Smart Contract - executable code that lives on blockchain
- Wallet - holds your accoun information (public key and private key)
- NFT - Non fungable token

### Blockchain is how crypto exists

- Blockchain can hold apps and code, and even Smart Contracts.
- Teal programming language for blockchain - Very low level.

## Problems with BLockchain

### Complex

- One year of training before handling state effectively and safely
- Tech changes fast
- Stage manaagement within a contract involves
  - Learning a new lanague like TEAL or solidity
  - Developing a skill set which is only appplicable to the protocal/blockchain that language supports
  - Limitations unique to each cryptographci protocol
- Solution
  - Leverage what you already know
  - Reach's syntax is closely related to JS
  - JS creates 95% of websites that exits
  - Blockhani agnostic
    - Deploy across multiple block with only small changes

### Expensive

- Developer Cost
  - Developer cost for niche skills
  - Protocol longevity and popularity is volatile
- Audits
  - Errors are costly on blockchain
  - Billions of dollars are lost or locked away each year
  - Months - long wait list
  - Can cost you or your teams thousands
  - It is a necessary evil

#### Solutions

    - Streamline forma verification
    - Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers: an auto verification process
    - Speed up mass adoption
      - less money lost
      - Waiting weeks or days instead of months for an audit
      - Apps hit the market at a faster rate
    - It helps the auditing process

### Tribal / Toxic

- Toxic
- Turf wars
  - Algorand vs Ethereum vs Dogecoin are incentivised to trash each other.
- There is no uniformity
  - There is no established way to do things
  - Decentralized App's have not existed in any meaningful capacity until recently
- Protocol communities but not a unified 'blockchain' community.
- Holier than thou.

#### Solutions

    - No More turf wars
      - Standardize ways of doing things
    - Use a language that creates 95% of websites that exist
    - Standard library in Javascript
      - NPM module
    - Bring in the JS Community
      - Get buy-in from the leaders of active developer communities

## Reach

- Reach is a programming language, compiler, and deployment process that allows development of smart contracts and distributed applications
