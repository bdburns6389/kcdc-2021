## We accelerate the team

### Theory of constraints

- Every process has a constraint and focusing on improving efforts on that constraing is the fastest and most effective path to imporved profitability.

### Systems Thinking

- Systems thinking is a holistic approach to analysis that focusese on the way that a systemcs constituent parts interrelate and how systems work over time and within the context of larger systemcs
